/**
 * @class Key Key.h This class generates two 8 bit SDES subkeys from a ten bit key provided to the constructor
 *
 * @authors: Brady Anderson, Jesse Babcock
 *
 * The Key class is used to generate the two 8 bit subkeys used by the SDES encryption algorithm from
 * a ten bit key provided to the constructor. The constructor takes an integer as an argument and
 * checks to ensure that it is the correct number of bits. It then passes it to several functions to permute the ten bit
 * number, shift the high 5 and the low 5 bits left, permute it to an eight bit number (creating the first subkey),
 * perform two more left shifts on the ten bit number, and finally a second 8 bit to generate the second subkey.
